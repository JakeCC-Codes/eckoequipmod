# EckoEquip [Hytale ModJam 2026 Submission]
> by JakeCCz

This is the source code for the Ecko Equip Mod made for the 2026 Hytale ModJam. The theme was "Echoes of the Machine", participants were given a time period of 4 days to work on their submission using the theme provided. [30/01/2026 - 03/01/2026]

Adds a variety of Echo Gadgets and Equipment that will prove to be extremely useful in your Hytale Adventure! This project takes the initial prompt "Echoes of the Machine" and adds a little sci-fi twist, making it extremely engaging for players. This mod was mainly tested in a Creative Flat World for accessibility purposes but is intended to be used in a more Adventure Mode setting.

Hence, the "Echo Shard Detector Device" only functions properly in Adventure Mode (Remember this when testing).
Note: However, this does not mean that the mod will not work in Creative Mode or is buggy, it has been tested bug free so this is a minor issue.

### Features

- **Echo Crystal Shards** - Custom ingredient used to craft Ecko Equipment in the **Arcanist's Workbench**.

- **Echo Shard Detector** - Metal Detector Device which acquires Echo Shards by sending vibrations through ores. (10% Chance of dropping an *Echo Shard*)

- **Ecko Boomerang** - Similar to an Echo, it will always come back, sending out Echo Vibrations with every collision.

- **Ecko Blade** - A laser sharp sword, so sharp it can cut through the sound barrier, sending out Echo Vibrations with each attack.

- **Ecko Blaster 9000** - A super sonicly, echo charged cannon which fires hyper-charged Echo Vibrations which combust into intense vibration energy upon impact.

> *"Overall I would say this was an enjoyable ModJam, the theme was a little hard to work with but encouraged a more creative approach from me. I also had many planned features that never made the final cut due to time constraints, such as, an Ore Detector Device, Anti Gravity Boots, Companion Golem (Which communicates via echo vibrations), Custom Robot Golem Boss, and last but not least... a fucking nuke LOL" - JakeCCz, 2026*
